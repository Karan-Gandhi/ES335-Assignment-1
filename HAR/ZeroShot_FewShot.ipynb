    "# 3. What are the limitations of Zero-Shot Learning and Few-Shot Learning in the context of classifying human activities based on featurized accelerometer data?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many limitations of using Large Language Models (LLMs) in general, especially for tasks such as classifying human activities based on featureized accelerometer data. The following are some common issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pretrained knowledge**: These approaches rely heavily on pretrained knowledge to generate new tokens. While Few-Shot Learning is capable of \"learning\" from new context, it still does not perform well on niche, domain-specific tasks like human activity classification with featurized accelerometer data due to the lack of such examples in training. This is why models are first fine-tuned on custom datasets beforehand for tasks like this. This also helps eliminate the inherent bias associated with the task in the already existing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: The scalability of using LLMs for classification tasks like this is bottlenecked by the context window of the LLM. In our case, Groq primarily has LLMs with a context window of size 8192. Mixtral had a slightly more generous limit of 32,768 tokens. Fortunately, Meta's new LLM - Llama 3.1 had the largest context window of 131,072 tokens. This turned out to be very useful in our case, especially for Few-Shot learning, as we could pass in more examples. However, using more tokens increases the time taken to process a prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Case**: LLMs are excellent in capturing semantic relationships between text. However, they might not perform as expected in tasks such as ours. One particularly famous and recent example is the question \"Which number is greater: 9.9 or 9.11?\" Llama 3 answered 9.11 which is incorrect. One probable reason for this is that numbers like 9.9 and 9.11 occur frequently in sites like GitHub and denote version numbers, and indeed, 9.11 is greater than 9.9 in such cases. Such results depend on the tokenizer used by the LLM. Llama 3's tokenizer treats \"11\" and \"9\" as single tokens, so it makes sense to say that 9.11 is greater than 9.9. This makes the approach of using LLMs ill-suited for our task as we work with data that is time-series, highly featurized, and very numerical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for comparing the limitations of Zero-Shot Learning and Few-Shot Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zero-Shot Learning**\n",
    "1. It performs poorly when the activities are dissimilar from the pretrained training data of the model or when the features lack any meanigful semantic relationship, like in the case of featurized accelerometer data.\n",
    "2. It often results in lower accuracy when compared to fully supervised methods. This can be demonstrated empirically as well by confirming that Few-Shot Learning and decision tree performed much better than it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Few-Shot Learning**\n",
    "1. Few-Shot learning methods can often lead to overfitting. While experimenting, we found that it incorrectly predicted 100% of values correctly because we did not shuffle the data. We suspect that it was because we gave the data in order: Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking Downstairs, Walking Upstairs repeatedly.\n",
    "2. While passing many examples may aid the model in capturing more information, it uses many tokens. We were forced to use the model with the highest context window of 131,072 tokens to fit in all the examples. This is computationally expensive, both, in terms of cost and performance."
